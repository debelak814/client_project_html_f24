            <p>At the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI), we are committed to supporting our students'
                academic success by offering a wide array of resources and services, including making sure that students
                have access to food. The Blue & Maize Cupboard is a student-run food pantry that provides free food and
                other essentials to students in need. The pantry is located in the School of Social Work Building and is
                open to all UMSI students. The Blue & Maize Cupboard is a great resource for students who are
                experiencing food insecurity or who are struggling to make ends meet. If you are in need of food
                assistance, please visit the Blue & Maize Cupboard during their regular hours of operation. You can view
                more information about their services at the <a href="https://mbc.studentlife.umich.edu">Blue & Maize
                    Cupboard</a> website.</p>
